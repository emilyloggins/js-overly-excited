# js-overly-excited

1. Create an addExcitement function that should console.log() rows of words. It should take an array containing the words of a sentence and output them in the developer console.
2. Add logic to addExcitement that places an exclamation point (!) after every third word. Read the following English statement and write the equivalent in JavaSript code to make it work. If the current value of the counter variable can be evenly divided by 3 (using the JavaScript remainder operator) add a single exclamation point (!) to the current word in the array.
